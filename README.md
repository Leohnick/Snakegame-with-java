# Snakegame-with-java
I created this game somehow for college project, so they are not at the perfect stage.
In this game, the file structure should be exactly like how it is structured in the repo. It's better to compile the board java file first before the snake file.
After this, things are pretty straightforward but if any help is required, drop me a message.
